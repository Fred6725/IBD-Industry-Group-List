# IBD Industry Group

If you are a Google Sheet user,
find out quickly which IBD Industry Group your ticker belongs to, using the VLOOKUP() function.
You can import the list on your sheet using =IMPORTDATA() function.

# Industry Group missing

If your ticker isn't in the list, you can use investors.com.
Tip your ticker and copy/past the group. 

As the group will be written differently, I also uploaded a list to get the correspondence:
